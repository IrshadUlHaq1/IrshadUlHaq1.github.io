### Structure and function of microbial communities in decaying wood and soil

Microbes play an essential role in wood decomposition and regulate biogeochemical processes. and maintain the functioning of soil and forest ecosystems

### Fungal wood decay mechanisms in boreal forests

The large carbon stores in boreal forests, primarily in deadwood, are significantly influenced by fungal decomposition mechanisms (white versus brown rot).

### Bacterial-fungal interactions in decaying wood and soil

The presence of a wide array of bacteria and fungi in soil and decaying wood can have important effects on biogeochemical processes, including bioremediation, in both natural and managed systems.
